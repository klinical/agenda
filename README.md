<h3 align="center">Why (did you make this)?</h3>
<ul align="center">
  <li> Boredom. </li>
  <li> After a brief search for a CLI todo app to easily keep track of my tasks, I realized something: these all suck. Too many features, complicated syntax... Should I really have to read an entire documentation guide just to be able to create a small list of tasks? </li>
  <li> I <3 Rust </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 align="center">What can I do with it (features)?</h3>
<ul align="center">
  <li> Create a task </li>
  <li> Update a task </li>
  <li> Remove a task </li>
  <li> List tasks </li>
  <li> Let me guess: you need more? </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 align="center">What can I do with the source code?</h3>
<p align="center">Anything. I don't care. copy and paste it, call it your own app. I really don't care.</h3>
